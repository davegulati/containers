# containers

A collection of Docker Compose configurations for the services I run locally or on my home lab.  
Each service lives in its own folder with its own `docker-compose.yml` file and environment configuration.

## üß© Overview

This repository centralizes all my Docker Compose setups ‚Äî databases, utilities, and self-hosted services ‚Äî in one place.  
Each stack is self-contained, portable, and version-controlled.

Each directory typically contains:

- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.env.example` (for configuration templates)
- Optional `README.md` (for service-specific notes)
